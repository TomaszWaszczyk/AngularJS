# Overview of BEAM - Mimble Wimble implementation

This is an up-to-date cheatsheet of news, events for BEAM.

[MimbleWimble](https://github.com/BeamMW) uses elliptic-curve cryptography that requires smaller keys than other cryptography types. In a network that is using the Mimblewimble protocol, there are no addresses on the blockchain, and the network’s data storage is highly efficient.

Mimblewimble needs about 10% of the data storage requirements of the Bitcoin network. This makes Mimblewimble highly scalable for storing the blockchain, significantly faster, and less centralized. Furthermore, the nature of the protocol allows for private transactions that are highly anonymous (more about this later).

Things that make BEAM special include:

* Users have complete control over privacy - a user decides which information will be available and to which parties, having complete control over his personal data in accordance to his will and applicable laws.
* Confidentiality without penalty - in BEAM confidential transactions do not cause bloating of the blockchain, avoiding excessive computational overhead or penalty on performance or scalability while completely concealing the transaction value.
* No trusted setup required
* Blocks are mined using Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm.
* Limited emission using periodic halving.
* No addresses are stored in the blockchain - no information whatsoever about either the sender or the receiver of a transaction is stored in the blockchain.
* Superior scalability through compact blockchain size - using the “cut-through” feature of Mimblewimble makes the BEAM blockchain orders of magnitude smaller than any other blockchain implementation.
* BEAM supports many transaction types such as escrow transactions, time locked transactions, atomic swaps and more.
* No premine. No ICO. Backed by a treasury, emitted from every block during the first five years.
* Implemented from scratch in C++.
