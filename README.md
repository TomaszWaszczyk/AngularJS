# Oveview of Substrate

This is an up-to-date cheatsheet of news, events, and onboarding materials for Substrate.

[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) is an open-source framework that lets you build entire, configurable blockchains in minimal time. Optionally, you can then deploy your blockchain to the [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) network, which has pooled security and other advantages. See a detailed summary [here](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/).

With Substrate, you get the following *customizable* functionalities out-of-the-box:
* A default PoS blockchain
* Upgradable runtimes
* Pluggable consensus (PoS, PoW, PoA)
* Block production, synchronization
* Efficient storage
* Efficient state machine
* P2P networking layer
* Built in crypto primitives
* Light client support
* Suite of [libraries](https://crates.parity.io/srml_staking/index.html?search=srml) to modify runtime logic, i.e. manage storage, accounts, staking, a treasury, consensus and more
* UI kits
